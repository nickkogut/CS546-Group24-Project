## Running the website
### Seed instructions:

1. Unzip tasks/seed_data.zip and put its contents into tasks/ (If it was unzipped into a new folder, make sure to remove it from that folder and place it directly here)
2. With a mongo server running, do "npm run seed"

### App running instructions

1. Open a terminal in the project's root directory
2. npm i
3. npm start
4. Connect at localhost:3000/

## Testing and using the site
### Sample Users
For testing, you may create a new account or use one of the following seeded sample accounts:

#### Name: TODO
Email: TODO \
Password: TODO \
Overview: TODO (i.e. this user has 2 jobs in their history and has applied to 4 jobs OR This is a fresh account where no personal info has been set yet)

#### Name: TODO
Email: TODO \
Password: TODO \
Overview: TODO (i.e. this user has 2 jobs in their history and has applied to 4 jobs OR This is a fresh account where no personal info has been set yet)

### Sample Usages
TODO: give some instructions for different ways to interact with the site. We should include which features are relevant to each one

### Adjustments to proposed core features:
- Core Feature 7: We moved the ability to filter by application status from the account page to the jobs page.
- TODO: any others?

### Additional notes
- Staten Island does not report payroll history data in our dataset for the Compare page. However, it does supply open job listings. It is intentional that the compare page does not allow filtering the borough to Staten Island.
